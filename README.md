This project is a training project. The project was completed as part of the IBM Data Science Professional Certification course on the courser.org platform (https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science). The project corresponds to a part of the Applied Data Science Capstone course.
Here I will provide a scenario of the project and an overview.
The commercial space age has arrived, companies are making space travel accessible to everyone. Virgin Galactic provides suborbital space flights. Rocket Lab is a provider of small satellites. Blue Origin makes suborbital and orbital reusable rockets. Perhaps the most successful is SpaceX.
SpaceX's achievements include:
1. Sending spacecraft to the International Space Station.
2. Starlink, a satellite internet constellation that provides access to satellite internet.
3. Sending manned missions into space.
One of the reasons SpaceX can do this is that rocket launches are relatively inexpensive. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website at $62 million; other providers cost more than $165 million each, much of the savings coming from SpaceX being able to reuse the first stage. So if we can determine whether the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of the launch.
Space X's Falcon 9 launches like a conventional rocket. The payload is contained within the fairings. The second stage, or second stage, helps to get the payload into orbit. The first stage does most of the work and is much larger than the second stage. This stage is quite large and expensive.
Unlike other rocket providers, SpaceX's Falcon 9 can recover the first stage. Sometimes the first stage doesn't land. Sometimes it crashes. Other times, Space X will sacrifice the first stage due to mission parameters such as payload, orbit, and client.
In this work, I will be taking on the role of a data scientist working for a new rocket company called Space Y that would like to compete with SpaceX, founded by billionaire industrialist Allon Musk. The task is to determine the price of each launch. I will do this by collecting information about Space X and creating dashboards for my team. I will also determine whether SpaceX will reuse the first stage. Instead of using rocket science to determine whether the first stage will land successfully, I will train a machine learning model and use publicly available information to predict whether SpaceX will reuse the first stage.
The project is done using Python.
The Python files posted here accomplish the following tasks:
1. Data collection (API and web scraping).
2. Primary data analysis.
3. Exploratory analysis using SQL.
4. Exploratory analysis using Pandas and Matplotlib.
5. Interactive visual analytics (Folium) and dashboards (Plotly Dash).
6. Predictive analysis (Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Decision Tree Classifier, and K-nearest neighbors).
